# Ringtones Web Project With .Net
 This repository contains the source code of a website that retrieves data from a database. It was made with MVC architecture using .Net.

 ## Overview
 Using .NET MVC and database integration, I adapted a ready-made website template to my needs. This gave my site a dynamic feel and allowed me to provide users with a more personalized experience.
 I used a Code-First approach to this project.
 I used the W3Layouts site to download a ready-made template for the project.
 In summary, this project retrieves content from the database and this data is used to customize and make dynamic the desired areas of a website. Model view controller architecture was used in the project.
 I used microsoft sql server as database.
